vidir2
======

`vidir2` is based on the original `vidir` utility from
[moreutils](http://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/). As such it is released
under the GPLv2 Licence.

Some improvements over the original `vidir` consist of being able to copy
files and directories, removing directories (not only files) and editing
where symlinks point to.

*Warning* This utility is used to change files, in particular it can delete
files on the filesystem, so use it with care, especially whith the `-f`
switch!
