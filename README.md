vidir2
======

`vidir2` is based on the original `vidir` utility from
[moreutils](http://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/). As such it is realeased under the
GPLv2 Licence.

Some improvements over the original `vidir` consist of being able to copy
files, and editing where symlinks point to.

*Warning* Some of these utilities can delete files on the filesystem, so
use them with care, especially when you use the `-f` switch!
